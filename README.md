### Project title:
* Automating deployments in GitHub codespaces

### Project category
* Software Engineering - Development project

### Key skill
* Strong programming background

### Required skills
*	Knowledge of programming using `Node.js` or similar frameworks.
*	Knowledge or willingness to learn building APIs using `Go`.
*	Fundamental knowledge of cloud computing and use of command line interfaces (`Linux`).
*	Understanding of REST APIs and use of `Docker`.
*	Knowledge of GitHub and the GitHub command line interface.

### Project idea
*	GitHub codespaces are a popular way of running prototype cloud applications. Each codespace is hosted by GitHub in a Docker container, running on a virtual machine. The project aims to the development of a custom API backend to allow front-end applications or systems to interact with Codespaces, including user authorization, access delegation, initializing GitHub repositories using custom programming seeds, deploying prototype applications using custom virtual resources and, using the API to manage GitHub workspaces such as updating applications and capturing terminal outputs.

### Support and resources
*	You will be provided with access to the Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services.
*	You will be provided with seed repositories and other resources to start your developments.

### Project outcome
*	You will learn how to integrate custom software and build microservices.
*	You will learn how to use popular cloud platforms.
*	You will develop skills in REST API development using `Node.js` and `Go`.
*	You will learn how to use modern DevOps pipelines for software development.

### Difficulty level
*	5/5
*	This is a challenging project with a heavy implementation. The project implementation will be organized around features. Not all features need to be developed for this project.
