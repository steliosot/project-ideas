Project title:
* Automating deployments in GitHub codespaces

Project category
* Development

Required skills.
*	Knowledge of programming using Node.js or similar frameworks
*	Knowledge or willingness to learn Golang
*	Fundamental knowledge of cloud computing and use of command line interfaces
*	Understanding of REST APIs and use of Docker
*	Use of GitHub

Project idea
*	GitHub codespaces are a popular way of running prototype cloud applications. Each codespace is hosted by GitHub in a Docker container, running on a virtual machine. The project aims to the development of a custom API backend to allow front-end applications or systems to interact with Codespaces, including user authorization, access delegation, initializing GitHub repositories using custom programming seeds, deploying prototype applications and, in general, using the API to manage GitHub workspaces.

Support and resources
*	You will be provided with access to Google Cloud platform or Amazon Web Services.
*	You will be provided with seed repositories and other resources to start your developments.

Project outcome
*	You will learn how to integrate custom software with the latest state-of-the-art systems.

Difficulty level
*	5/5. This is a challenging project with a heavy implementation.
